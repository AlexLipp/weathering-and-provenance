ABSTRACT: Quaternary basaltic rocks of the bimodal Blackfoot Volcanic FieldBVF in southeastern Idaho are normatively classified as olivine andquartz tholeiites. Eruptive vents and lava flows are located in theBasin and Range tectonic province, adjacent to the southern border ofthe eastern Snake River Plain ESRP volcanic province. This studycompares physical volcanology, petrography, and geochemistry of BVFbasalts with contemporaneous basalts in the Basin and Range and on theESRP in order to determine possible influences of ESRP magmatism onBasin and Range magmatism. Basalts in the study area represent bothstrombolian and hawaiian styles of volcanism, which are typicallyfound in the Basin and Range, and not on the ESRP. Geochemicalcomparisons between the above provinces and the study area indicatethat BVF basalts share many characteristics with ESRP basalts and notwith Basin and Range basalts. Geochemical and isotopic evidencesuggests a lithospheric source for BVF basalts, similar to the sourcebelieved to have produced the ESRP basalts. Typical Basin and Rangebasalts are not likely represented in the study area. The proposedsimilarity in ESRP and BVF source regions has significant implicationfor the extent of ESRP magmatic influence in southeastern Idaho; thisis consistent with recently proposed geophysical models that depictESRP-like source material beneath the BVF.

ABSTRACT: The Long Valley Volcanic Field in east-central California straddles the East Sierran frontal fault zone, overlapping the Sierra Nevada and western Basin and Range Provinces. Long Valley volcanism began about 4 Ma during Pliocene time and has continued intermittently through the Holocene. The current (post-1980) seismic unrest at Long Valley, accompanied by uplift of the resurgent dome, may signal the onset of a new episode of regional extension and basalt injection into the residual magma chamber.

ABSTRACT: Tephra layers volcanic ash and tuff beds of late Cenozoic age in east-central and southern California are identified and correlated by the chemical composition of volcanic glass, stratigraphic criteria, and petrographic characteristics. Among widespread tephra units identified are the Lava Creek ash bed 0.62 m.y., the Bishop ash bed 0.73 m.y., and the Huckleberry Ridge ash bed 2.01 m.y.. All three are identified for the first time in marine strata. Identification of these and other tephra units permits correlation of upper Cenozoic sedimentary strata deposited in marine, fluvial, and lacustrine environments and helps reconcile provincial marine and continental biostratigraphic chronologies.

ABSTRACT: The <80 ka basalts-basanites of the Potrillo Volcanic Field (PVF)    form scattered scoria cones, lava flows and maars adjacent to the New    Mexico-Mexico border. MgO ranges up to 12.5%; lavas with MgO<10.7%    have fractionated both olivine and clinopyroxene. Cumulate fragments    are common in the lavas, as are subhedral megacrysts of aluminous    clinopyroxene (with pleonaste inclusions) and kaersutitic amphibole.    REE modelling indicates that these megacrysts could be in equilibrium    with the PVF melts at approximately 1.6-1.7 GPa pressure. The lavas    fall into two geochemical groups: the Main Series (85% of lavas) have  major- and trace-element abundances and ratios closely resembling    those of worldwide ocean-island alkali basalts and basanites (OIB);    the Low-K Series (15%) differ principally by having relatively low K    (sub 2) O and Rb contents. Otherwise, they are chemically    indistinguishable from the Main Series lavas. Sr- and Nd-isotopic    ratios in the two series are identical and vary by scarcely more than    analytical error, averaging (super 87) Sr/ (super 86) Sr = 0.70308 (SD    = 0.00004) and (super 143) Nd/ (super 144) Nd = 0.512952 (SD =    0.000025). Such compositions would be expected if both series    originated from the same mantle source, with Low-K melts generated    when amphibole remained in the residuum. Three PVF lavas have very low    Os contents (<14 ppt) and appear to have become contaminated by    crustal Os. One Main Series picrite has 209 ppt Os and has a gamma    (sub Os) value of +13.6, typical for OIB. This contrasts with    published (super 187) Os/ (super 188) Os ratios for Kilbourne Hole    peridotite mantle xenoliths, which give mostly negative gamma (sub Os)    values and show that Proterozoic lithospheric mantle forms a thick    Mechanical Boundary Layer (MBL) that extends to approximately 70 km    depth beneath the PVF area. The calculated mean primary magma, in    equilibrium with Fo (sub 89) , has Na (sub 2) O and FeO contents that    give a lherzolite decompression melting trajectory from 2.8 GPa (95 km    depth) to 2.2 GPa (70 km depth). Inverse modelling of REE abundances    in Main Series Mg-rich lavas is successful for a model invoking    decompression melting of convecting sub-lithospheric lherzolite mantle    (epsilon Nd = 6.4; T (sub p) approximately 1400 degrees C) between 90    and 70 km. Nevertheless, such a one-stage model cannot account for the    genesis of the Low-K Series because amphibole would not be stable    within convecting mantle at T (sub f) approximately 1400 degrees C.    These magmas can only be accommodated by a three-stage model that    envisages a Thermal Boundary Layer (TBL) freezing conductively onto    the approximately 70 km base of the Proterozoic MBL during the    approximately 20 Myr tectonomagmatic quiescence before PVF eruptions.    As it grew, this was veined by hydrous small-fraction melts from below.

ABSTRACT: Exposed around the margins of Mono basin and the periphery of Long Valley caldera are approximately 100 km (super 3) of potassic, basic to intermediate lavas that record high water and oxygen fugacities. Most eruptions occurred between 4 and 2 Ma, although sporadic potassic volcanism continued into the Quaternary with a pulse between 0.1 and 0.5 Ma, approximately 15 km northeast of Mono basin. The lava types include absarokite, minette, hornblende lamprophyre, trachybasalt, and trachyandesite. Estimated water contents for lavas without hydrous phenocrysts range between 2 and 3 wt%, considerably more than mid-ocean ridge, oceanic island, or back-arc magmas. Calculated f O (sub 2) values fall between -0.4 and +1.2 log units of the Ni-NiO buffer. Although this potassic suite was erupted in an extensional tectonic setting at the western margin of the Basin and Range province, its high K (sub 2) O/TiO (sub 2) and low Zr/Ba ratios suggest a subduction-modified mantle source. If subduction was the process that enriched the lithospheric mantle in large-ion lithophile elements (K, Ba, etc.), it was also a mechanism for mantle oxidation and hydration. October 1993.

ABSTRACT: Subduction-related and continental intraplate type magmatism coexisted in the San Pedro-Ceboruco SPC graben in western Mexico in a rather unusual close association. The magmatic systems belong to the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt TMVB, the active volcanic arc linked to subduction of the Rivera and Cocos plates beneath the North American plate. Three different magmatic series are recognized in the San Pedro-Ceboruco graben: calc-alkaline, Na-alkaline, and transitional. The transitional series can be further subdivided into: Low-Ti; High-Ti and Amado Nervo groups. The different magmatic series are characterized by variable LILE/HFSE and LREE/HFSE ratios. The Na-alkaline series has the most radiogenic Nd compositions and the lowest super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr 0.70320-0.70344. The calc-alkaline series shows the lowest epsilon sub Nd and the highest super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr 0.70395-0.70402 overlapping the values for the transitional High-Ti group 0.70390-0.70404. Sr isotopic compositions for transitional Low-Ti 0.70367-0.70394 and transitional Amado Nervo 0.70351-0.70389 groups are intermediate between those of the Na-alkaline and calc-alkaline rocks. All the studied rocks show similar super 207 Pb/ super 204 Pb 15.58-15.61 and super 208 Pb/ super 204 Pb 38.41-38.65, but super 206 Pb/ super 204 Pb discriminates well the Na-alkaline series 18.90-19.03 from all the others 18.68-18.75. Compositional and isotopic data suggest that the different series derive from distinct parental magmas, which were generated by partial melting of a heterogeneous mantle source characterized by two different components. A depleted mantle DM component with low super 206 Pb/ super 204 Pb and an enriched EM component characterized by high super 206 Pb/ super 204 Pb. These two components mix together in various degrees and are both overprinted, although in different proportions, by metasomatic processes. Metasomatism of the mantle wedge was induced by subduction-related agents resulting from the dehydration/melting of subducted sediments and characterized by variable fluid/melt proportions.

ABSTRACT: Ash beds associated with the three climactic Yellowstone ignimbritesform important Quaternary chronostratigraphic markers over much of thecontinental United States. Previous K-Ar ages determined on crystalconcentrates from these ashes varied by as much as 60-100 k.y.Laser-fusion super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar dating of single sanidinegrains from these units reveals a small number of grains withanomalously old ages. Eliminating these from the weighted averagesresults in highly precise refined ages of 2.003+ or -0.014, 1.293+ or-0.012, and 0.602+ or -0.004 Ma 2sigma errors for the HuckleberryRidge Tuff, Mesa Falls Tuff, and member B of the Lava Creek Tuff,respectively. Individual single-grain ages that are slightly too oldcould result from incomplete degassing of xenocrysts in the magma.Electron-microprobe analyses of sanidine splits reveal no obviousxenocrystic compositions, suggesting another possibility--thatphenocrysts from the crystallized rind of the magma chamber werere-entrained into the magma prior to eruption. Contamination andnatural variation in phenocryst age may create larger uncertainty inbulk-crystal dating of young silicic volcanic rocks than incompleteextraction of Ar from sanidine.

ABSTRACT: This region of Yellowstone National Park has been the active focus ofone of the Earth's largest magmatic systems for more than 2 millionyears. The resulting volcanism has been characterized by the eruptionof voluminous rhyolites and subordinate basalts but virtually no lavasof intermediate composition. The magmatic system at depth remainsactive and drives the massive hydrothermal circulation for which thepark is widely known. Studies of the volcanic field using geologicmapping and petrology have defined three major cycles of rhyoliticvolcanism, each climaxed by the eruption of a rhyolitic ash-flow sheethaving a volume of hundreds of thousands of cubic kilometers. Thefield also has been analyzed in terms of its magmatic and tectonicevolution, including its regional relation to the Snake River plainand to basin-range tectonic extension.

CATEGORY CODES: Whole-rock major and trace element and O, Sr, Nd and Pb isotopic data are reported for 3.0 0.89 Ma lamproites from the Leucite Hills, Wyoming, USA. The two main groups of lamproites, madupitic lamproites and phlogopite lamproites, are geochemically distinct and cannot be related to one another by either fractional crystallization or crustal contamination. It seems likely that the geochemical differences between these two rock types are related to variations in source mineralogy and depth of partial melting. The high Mg-number and large ion lithophile element abundances and negative eNd values of the lamproites indicate a mantle source that has experienced stages of both depletion and enrichment. The negative Nb, Ta and Ti anomalies in mantle-normalized trace element diagrams and low time-integrated U/Pb, Rb/Sr and Sm/Nd ratios of both lamproite groups and other Cenozoic igneous rocks from the Wyoming Archean Province indicate an ancient metasomatic enrichment (>1.0 Ga) of the mantle source associated with the subduction of carbonate-bearing sediments. Other chemical characteristics of the Leucite Hills lamproites, especially their high K2O and volatile contents, are attributed to more recent metasomatism (<100 Ma) involving influx from upwelling mantle during back-arc extension or plume activity.

ABSTRACT: More than 200 new analyses for major and minor elements, including halogens, are presented for obsidians > 70 percent SiO sub 2  of worldwide occurrence. An additional 130 analyses for major elements are compiled from the literature. This data base establishes the patterns of chemical variation in obsidians in the context of five major plate-tectonic regimes of the Earth's crust, and in terms of major petrogenetic processes. All major and many minor elements are summarized individually.

ABSTRACT: South Sister is an active, calc-alkaline strato-volcano located in west-central Oregon in the high Cascades. South Sister contains lavas that range from basalt 50% SiO sub 2  to rhyolite 75% SiO sub 2 . Within this compositional spectrum the lavas are restricted to three distinct populations: basalt/basaltic-andesite, andesite and rhyolite. Compositional, textural and mineralogic criteria indicate that the basaltic-andesites are hybrid mixtures of basalt and andesite magma. This implies that the system is characterized by basalt, andesite and rhyolite magma populations that are separated from one another by composition gaps. Major, minor and trace element modeling suggests that the three magma populations are related to one another primarily through fractional crystallization. We propose a standard fractionation model for generating compositional diversity amongst erupted lavas wherein in situ fractional crystallization occurs within a downward descending solidification front. Extraction and eruption of the interstitial fractionated liquid, now separated from the parental liquid by a composition gap, occurs only after the percentage of crystallization within the solidification front has exceeded the appropriate critical crystallinity value for the given parental magma. We envision a magmatic plumbing system characterized by multiple, independently solidifying bodies of magma. Thus, at any given time, discrete bodies of basalt, andesite and rhyolite magma may exist. Interaction and mixing among these bodies could generate the continuous range of lava compositions that characterize most calc-alkaline volcanic complexes.

ABSTRACT: Thirty-four K-Ar ages, supporting paleomagnetic measurements. Three periods of volcanic activity: (1) 7.6 to 6.5, (2) 4.5 to 3.6 and (3) 1.0 to at least 0.015 m.y. ago. Long-term effects of pedogenesis and erosion on volcanic landforms in an arid environment. The most stable geomorphic surfaces in the field occur on flows between 0.25 and 0.75 m.y old. Younger flows are dominated by eolian aggradation and outcrop rubbling, and older flows are dominated by surface runoff and fluvial dissection. Progressive pedogenesis and a subsequent shift from infiltration to surface runoff is proposed to explain this temporal variation in land-surface stability.--Modified journal abstract.

ABSTRACT: The chemical compositions, ages, and Nd and Sr isotopic compositions of Miocene basaltic volcanic rocks from the southwestern Basin and Range Province were measured. The data presented, and other data obtained from the literature show that temporal variations in the Nd and Sr isotopic compositions are typically correlated with the timing of local crustal extension. The isotopic variations cannot be accounted for by crustal contamination, and are best interpreted as indicating the involvement of subcontinental lithospheric mantle as a major source of basalt magma before and during the early stages of extension, giving way to asthenospheric sources as extension proceeds. It is inferred that the basalt isotopic and age data provide information about the amount and timing of changes of the overall lithosphere thickness during extension. If this inference is valid, the inferred lithosphere thickness vs. time histories can be compared to the amount and timing of upper crustal extension to evaluate competing models for lithospheric strain during continental extension. The depth of the lithosphere-asthenospshere boundary is inferred primarily from the isotopic data, but can be refined by accounting for differences in the depth of origin of the basalts as suggested by differences in the degree of silica saturation nepheline normative vs. hypersthene normative. The transition between silica saturated and undersaturated magmas is dependent on many factors, but for the conditions likely to apply to the Basin and Range Miocene volcanism, it corresponds to a depth of origin of 50+ or -10 km. The data presented show strong support for the inferred mantle geochemical stratigraphy, and the inferred modern depths to the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary are consistent with available seismic refraction and structural data. In the highly extended regions near the eastern and western margins of the southwestern Basin and Range, temporal changes in basalt isotopic compositions indicate that the subjacent lithospheric mantle thinned contemporaneously with the upper crust, as would be predicted for pure shear. These areas are also characterized by relatively high although still low basalt extrusion rates. In contrast, upper crustal extension in the Death Valley area was not accompanied by significant thinning of the subjacent lithospheric mantle, which implies that the location of lithospheric thinning was offset from the location of upper crustal extension as in a simple shear model. The total amount of lithospheric thinning is generally less than would be expected from the magnitude of upper crustal extension and is more evenly distributed; this suggests that there is also a component of distributed shear.

ABSTRACT: We present a new model for the genesis of low-delta super 18 O rhyolites of the Yellowstone caldera based on analyses of zircons and individual quartz phenocrysts. Low-delta super 18 O rhyolites were erupted soon after the massive caldera-forming Lava Creek Tuff eruption 602 ka, approximately 1000 km super 3  and contain xenocrysts of quartz and zircon inherited from precaldera rhyolites. These zircons are isotopically zoned and out of equilibrium with their host low-delta super 18 O melts and quartz. Diffusion modeling predicts that magmatic disequilibria of oxygen isotopes persists for as much as tens of thousands of years following nearly total remelting of the hydrothermally altered igneous roots of the depressed cauldron, in which the alteration-resistant quartz and zircon initially retained their delta super 18 O values. These results link melting to caldera collapse, rule out rapid or catastrophic magma-meteoric water interaction, and indicate wholesale melting rather than assimilation or partial melting.

ABSTRACT: The eastern Snake River plain in southern Idaho, Western UnitedStates, is characterized by 1-2 km of Pleistocene to late Pliocenebasalt overlying rhyolite caldera complexes. Cyclic variations in thechemical composition of basalts from 1136 m of scientific drill coreshow that the parent magmas of these lavas evolved by crystalfractionation at shallow to intermediate crustal depths, punctuated byepisodic recharge with more primitive compositions and assimilation ofadjacent wall rock. We have identified 10 upward fractionation cyclesand four reversed cycles; assimilation of sialic crust was limited andmainly affects the oldest basalts, which directly overlie rhyolites.We infer that the crystal fractionation and/or recharge cycles tookplace in a series of sill-like intrusions at intermediate crustaldepths that now form a layered mafic intrusion that underlies theeastern Snake River plain at depth. This layered sill complex isrepresented by the approximately 10-km-thick basaltic sill that hasbeen imaged seismically at approximately 12-22 km depth. Theassociation of this mid-crustal sill complex with geochemicalfractionation cycles in basalt supports the concept that exposedlayered mafic intrusions may be linked to overlying basalt provincesthat have since been removed by erosion.

ABSTRACT: Nearly 180 new whole-rock potassium-argon age dates from the southern Oregon Cascade volcanic province are reported, each with a corresponding major- and trace-element geochemical analysis. K-Ar results from the Klamath River canyon region astride the California-Oregon border delineate no obvious temporal break in volcanic activity. However, 25 mi farther to the north in the Mount McLoughlin-Brown Mountain-Little Butte Creek region, a time gap in volcanic activity has been documented to exist between 17 and 7 Ma. Mafic volcanic activity, which marks the inception of renewed volcanism between 6 and 7 Ma ago, is compositionally quite diverse, ranging from olivine trachybasalt to low-potassium high-alumina olivine tholeiite basalt.

ABSTRACT: The eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP) volcanic basin in southeast Idaho is underlain by approximately 1 km of dominantly Pliocene-Quaternary olivine tholeiite basalt and interbedded sediment. The F basalt flow group is a stratigraphic marker bed near the top of the regional aquifer and underlies a portion of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, where radiochemical and chemical wastewater has been discharged to the aquifer. This flow group erupted during an unusual, short-lived period of reversed magnetic polarity approximately 565 ka, probably in < or =200 years. This study uses new petrographic, geochemical, and isotopic analyses of the flow group to refine the subsurface stratigraphy. This sequence of lava flows is uneroded, apparently comagmatic, and is observed in drill core over an area of approximately 75 km (super 2) between approximately 120-220 m depth. Lithologic logs for six sections of F flows in drill-core reveal textural discordance within the sequence and that the thickest ( approximately 55 m) lie in the southwest part of the study region and contain an upper portion ( approximately 15-23 m) that is texturally coarser and significantly enriched in incompatible elements relative to the remainder of the sequence. In addition, lava flows in the lower sequence have lower initial (super 87) Sr/ (super 86) Sr isotopic ratios than the upper flows (0.7068 vs. 0.7071) while all exhibit similar (super 143) Nd/ (super 144) Nd isotope ratios ( approximately 0.5124; epsilon (sub Nd) approximately -4.3). Petrographic, isotopic, and geochemical features support correlations between sampled sections and define two flow groups within the F sequence. Variations in the texture and stratigraphy of the two flow groups indicate that they were derived from multiple coeval eruptive centers aligned along a common rift or fissure system, and not from a central vent complex. The stratigraphy of the entire F sequence is consistent with formation by constructional volcanic processes and is unaffected by post depositional structural offsets.

ABSTRACT: Whole-rock major element, trace element, and Sr-Nd isotopic analysesof samples taken from Idaho National Engineering and EnvironmentalLaboratory INEEL core holes are used to correlate subsurfacetholeiitic basalt lava flow groups in the Test Area North TANregion, and to evaluate time-space variations in their geochemicalsignatures. New super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar ages are included tosupplement existing dates in order to confirm major eruptive episodes.Incompatible trace elements range by factors of approximately 7-10;major oxides, especially MgO, range by factors of approximately 2-3;initial super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr ratios range from approximately0.706 to 0.708; and super 143 Nd/ super 144 Nd ratios range fromapproximately 0.706 to 0.708; and super 143 Nd/ super 144 Ndratios range from approximately 0.5122 to 0.5125. These data suggestthat each flow group represents a single shield-building monogeneticeruption derived from a separate magma batch. The geochemical patternsof flow groups older than ca. 0.8 Ma at TAN are compared to youngerca. 0.2-0.6 Ma flow groups located in the southern INEEL approximately 30 km distance to assess regional variations. No flowgroups are known to correlate between these two regions although someTAN flow groups are found in core hole 2-2A located approximately 10km south. Only the deepest flow group at TAN, with three measuredradiometric ages ranging from 2.38 to 2.46 Ma, is correlated to corehole USGS 126-A located on Lava Ridge approximately 9 km northwest ofTAN as well as core hole 2-2A. Recurrence of fairly primitiveMgO-rich, La-poor flow groups in the northern and southern INEELsuggests that similar processes of magma genesis and shield growth areoperative on eastern Snake River Plain volcanic rift zones regardlessof age.

ABSTRACT: Stratigraphic and mineralogical information and trace-element chemical data for a group of over 40 middle Pleistocene Bishop ash beds that occur at widely scattered localities in the Western United States are presented. Seventeen newly determined K-Ar ages of the Bishop Tuff also are given. Trace-element chemical data and other information are tabulated for a group of ash beds that are chemically and mineralogically allied with the Bishop ash. These older ash beds occur in California, Nevada, and Utah, and probably formed in late Pliocene to early Pleistocene time during early volcanic stages of the evolutionary magmatic process that culminated in the eruption of the Bishop Tuff.

ABSTRACT: The junction of the western Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Gulf of California represents a superposition of subduction and continental rifting tectonic regimes in the late Cenozoic. Subduction of the oceanic Rivera plate has caused late Cenozoic uplift of western Mexico, forming the Jalisco Block. This paper addresses three questions: Where is the northern boundary of the Jalisco Block; how is the continental fracture system related to that offshore; and what is the spatial distribution and composition of subduction-related lavas? super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar dates on Cretaceous to Paleogene silicic ash flows show that the northern boundary of the Jalisco Block may be defined by the abrupt change in basement age from Cretaceous to Miocene. super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar and K-Ar dates on faulted lavas from the Nayarit region indicate that extension at the edge of the Jalisco Block has occurred since ca. 4.2 Ma. The least principal stress  sub 3  direction associated with these faults has had two different orientations from 4.2 Ma to the present: Several Pliocene to Holocene 4.20, 1.05, and 0.65 Ma lava flows, and aligned cinder cones have a N45 degrees W associated least principal stress direction, whereas three Pliocene 3.36, 3.38, and 3.11 Ma lava flows are cut by faults indicating a north to north-northeast least principal stress direction. The two different stress directions may arise either from structural features in the basement of the arc or from changes in offshore plate boundaries e.g., 2.5 Ma when the Rivera and Mathematicians plates were locked together. Whole-rock major and trace element analyses of lavas from the coastal Nayarit region reveal three different lava types: an alkali basalt series, basaltic andesite, and andesite. The alkali basalts show FeO and TiO sub 2 enrichment and have low Ba/Zr and Ba/La ratios, consistent with derivation from an oceanic-island-type mantle. The basaltic andesites and andesites are both alkaline and calc-alkaline, contain hydrous phenocrysts, and have high Sr/Zr and La/Nb ratios, consistent with a subduction-related source. Among these lavas there is a correlation between Sr/Zr, oxygen fugacity, and H sub 2 O contents, suggesting that an oxidized, hydrous fluid is involved in the genesis of the subduction-related lavas. The distribution of subduction-related volcanic centers in the coastal Nayarit region, and areas southeast within the Jalisco Block, defines a volcanic front that parallels the Middle America Trench and is consistent with a 45 degrees dip on the subducted Rivera plate.

ABSTRACT: Geologic mapping, K-Ar, and (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar agedeterminations, supplemented by paleomagnetic measurements andgeochemical data, are used to quantify the Quaternary volcanic historyof the Crater Lake region in order to define processes and conditionsthat led to voluminous explosive eruptions. The Cascade arc volcanoknown as Mount Mazama collapsed during its climactic eruption ofapproximately 50 km (super 3) of mainly rhyodacitic magmaapproximately 7700 yr ago to form Crater Lake caldera. The Mazamaedifice was constructed on a Pleistocene silicic lava field, amidemonogenetic and shield volcanoes ranging from basalt to andesitesimilar to parental magmas for Mount Mazama. Between 420 ka and 35 ka,Mazama produced medium-K andesite and dacite in 2:1 proportion. Theedifice was built in many episodes; some of the more voluminousoccurred approximately coeval with volcanic pulses in the surroundingregion, and some were possibly related to deglaciation followingmarine oxygen isotope stages (MIS) 12, 10, 8, 6, 5.2, and 2. Magmas asevolved as dacite erupted many times, commonly associated with orfollowing voluminous andesite effusion. Establishment of the climacticmagma chamber was under way when the first preclimactic rhyodacitesvented ca. 27 ka. The silicic melt volume then grew incrementally atan average rate of 2.5 km (super 3) k.y. (super -1) for nearly 20 k.y.The climactic eruption exhausted the rhyodacitic magma and brought upcrystal-rich andesitic magma, mafic cumulate mush, and wall-rockgranodiorite. Postcaldera volcanism produced 4 km (super 3) ofandesite during the first 200-500 yr after collapse, followed at ca.4800 yr B.P. by 0.07 km (super 3) of rhyodacite. The average eruptionrate for all Mazama products was approximately 0.4 km (super 3) k.y.(super -1) , but major edifice construction episodes had rates ofapproximately 0.8 km (super 3) k.y. (super -1) . The long-termeruption rate for regional monogenetic and shield volcanoes wasapproximately 0.07 km (super 3) k.y. (super -1) , but onlyapproximately 0.02 km (super 3) k.y. (super -1) when the two majorshields are excluded. Plutonic xenoliths and evidence forcrystallization differentiation imply that the amount of magmaintruded beneath Mount Mazama is several times that which has beenerupted. The eruptive and intrusive history reflects competitionbetween (1) crystallization driven by degassing and hydrothermalcooling and (2) thermal input from a regional magma flux focused atMazama. Before ca. 30 ka, relatively small volumes of noneruptedderivative magma crystallized to form a composite pluton because theupper crust had not been heated sufficiently to sustain voluminousconvecting crystal-poor melt. Subsequently, and perhaps notcoincidentally, during MIS 2, a large volume of eruptible silicicmagma accumulated in the climactic chamber, probably because ofheating associated with mantle input to the roots of the system assuggested by eruption of unusually primitive magnesian basalticandesite and tholeiite west of Mazama.

ABSTRACT: Isotopic and geochemical variations in basalts have commonly been used to map out and characterize mantle source regions in the western United States. It has been suggested that some of this variability is a product of cryptic crustal contamination and not mantle heterogeneity. To test this hypothesis, mantle xenolithic lavas, which presumably travel through the crust too quickly to be contaminated, were studied in detail. Cones from two eastern California alkali basaltic fields, Big Pine in Owens Valley and Cima in the Mojave Desert, were chosen for study. In the two study areas, there is little geochemical and isotopic variation within individual cones, but there is significant variation between cones. Lavas from a peridotite-bearing Waucoba cone of the Big Pine field have 46-48 wt% SiO sub 2 and 9-9.5 wt% MgO. An adjacent nonxenolithic cone has much higher SiO sub 2 51 wt% and lower MgO 5.5-7 wt%. Both cones have indistinguishable super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr ratios of 0.7059-0.7060 and epsilon sub Nd values of -2.4 to -1.6. The nonxenolithic cone can be related to the peridotite-bearing cone by 4 wt% fractionation of olivine and 14 wt% addition of granodiorite. The Cima lavas have 48-49 wt% SiO sub 2 , 5-6 wt% MgO, and abundant peridotite and gabbro xenoliths. The Mgof these lavas are too low to be in equilibrium with mantle olivine in spite of the abundance of peridotites. The low Mgcould be explained by high pressure fractionation before picking up the xenoliths. These lavas have constant but more depleted  super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr = 0.7029; epsilon sub Nd = 8.8 to 9.7 isotopic values. Lavas from both areas show minor evidence of crustal contamination in the form of sparse quartz xenocrysts. Cryptic crustal contamination did not play a role in the chemical characteristics of any of the lavas studied, and may be limited to nonxenolithic lavas.

ABSTRACT: Lassen Peak is a large volcanic dome of late Pleistocene age at the southern end of the Cascades arc. This dacitic dome has a complex phenocryst assemblage of mixed-magma origin and has been effectively dated for the first time using the super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar technique. Emplacement of the dome occurred after an advance of late Pleistocene glaciers from an older volcanic cone to the southwest and from a large volcanic plateau to the east. Emplacement of the Lassen Peak dome before the latest major Pleistocene glaciation-correlated by previous workers with the Tioga glaciation of the Sierra Nevada-formed a high peak that intercepted some of the precipitation that previously had fed the plateau ice cap, forming a 10-km-long glacier from a cirque on the northeast side of the peak. The weighted mean super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar age of the dacite of Lassen Peak is 28.3+ or -2.7 ka. Comparison of its remanent magnetic direction to that of sedimentary deposits at Mono Lake, California, indicates a correlation to strata of 27+ or -1 ka. The dacite of Kings Creek, which erupted from the site of Lassen Peak before a glacial advance that predated the Lassen Peak dome, overlies peat that has a U-Th-calibrated super 14 C age of 37.6+ or -0.2 ka. The dacite of Kings Creek yielded a super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar age of 32+ or -17 ka. The paleomagnetism of this dacite is similar to that of Mono Lake sediments of 35+ or -1 ka age. Thus, a late Pleistocene glacial advance probably began in the Lassen region between about 35 and 27 ka.

ABSTRACT: Incision of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, widely thought to have happened between ca. 6 and 1.2 Ma, has continued at variable rates along the canyon over the past approximately 500 k.y., based on measurements of bedrock incision combined with U-series and super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar ages. River incision rates downstream of the Toroweap fault in the western Grand Canyon are about half the approximately 140 m/m.y. incision rate calculated for a distance of at least 200 km upstream of the fault. We hypothesize that this differential incision is due to west-down slip on the Toroweap fault of 94 + or - 6 m/m.y. based on measured offset of the newly dated Upper Prospect basalt flow, which is the major middle-late Quaternary slip evident along the river. Regional incision has been driven mostly by base-level fall related to drainage reversal off the Colorado Plateau ca. 6 Ma. Because local normal faulting is lower in rate than this regional incision and is likely an expression of Basin and Range extension and subsidence rather than uplift, this is a case where active faulting diminishes, but does not drive, incision. Quaternary incision rates are insufficient to have carved the Grand Canyon in 6 m.y., suggesting either that rates have decreased through time as the original base-level signal has attenuated, or that some component of the canyon relief we see today existed prior to Colorado River integration.

ABSTRACT: East-northeast extension ca. 24 Ma at Rodeo and Nazas, Mexico, was accompanied by an eruption of hawaiites, marking some of the earliest intraplate-type mafic alkalic volcanism associated with development of the southern Basin and Range Province. An earlier extensional pulse, 32.3-30.6 Ma, concurrent with subduction-related rhyolitic volcanism of the Sierra Madre Occidental, is the earliest established extension in the southern Basin and range Province. The Rodeo hawaiites are mostly along or just west of the north-northwest-striking, west-dipping Rodeo fault, a major breakaway fault that separates moderately extended terrane to the west from less extended terrane to the east. Hawaiites and interbedded conglomerates in the Rodeo half graben are flat lying to gently tilted and cut by the Rodeo fault. Underlying Eocene-Oligocene ash-flow tuffs to the west are cut by numerous west-dipping faults and tilted as much as 40 degrees . Nazas hawaiites are also along north-northwest-striking faults but are generally unfaulted. Like other Miocene mafic alkalic volcanic rocks from the southern Basin and Range Province, those from Rodeo and Nazas are characterized by (1) moderately evolved hawaiitic compositions, (2) abundant megacrysts, including sodic plagioclase (An (sub 26-51) ), olivine ( approximately Fo (sub 55) ), Al-augite (7-9 wt % Al (sub 2) O (sub 3) ), and a wide variety of spinels, (3) lack of granulitic or peridotitic xenoliths, (4) variable Cs enrichments, and (5) isotopic compositions that indicate interaction with crust ( (super 87) Sr/ (super 86) Sr (sub i) = 0.7037-0.7041; epsilon (sub Nd) = 4.8-2.8; (super 206) Pb/ (super 204) Pb (sub i) = 18.91-18.77; (super 207) Pb/ (super 204) Pb (sub i) = 15.57-15.60). These observations are consistent with a model whereby Miocene intraplate-type magmas rose slowly through the lithosphere, differentiating and interacting with the crust. The megacrysts are interpreted as disrupted gabbroic bodies, formed by slow cooling of mafic alkalic magmas that stagnated in the lower crust, possibly during the earlier extensional episode. Many of the elemental and isoptopic parameters used to probe mantle sources of mafic volcanic rocks have been seriously obscured by crystallization, crustal interaction, and megacryst incorporation, complicating efforts to identify temporal changes in mantle source regions during development of the southern Basin and Range Province.

ABSTRACT: Potassium-argon dates on more than 50 whole-rock samples of volcanic extrusive and pyroclastic rocks of the Sierra Nevada are used with the stratigraphy to determine cenozoic and chronology regional correlation. Andesite pebbles from Wheatland Formation, which contains Eocene mollusks, give a composite date of 53.5 m.y. Dates of 19.9 to 33.2 m.y. on 18 early rhyoltic tuffs show a late Oligocene-early Miocene major period of rhyolitic volcanism; some rhyolite, however, gives dates of 4.7 m.y. The Mehrten Formation and andestic equivalents, including Table Mountain and other latites dated at 8.8 to 9.3 m.y. are middle Miocene-late Pliocene. Dates of 2.9 to 3.5 m.y. on basalts at elevations below Matthes' profile of the Pliocene San Joaquin River show that the Canyon stage of erosion was started by late Pliocene.

ABSTRACT: Low-silica basanite, basanite, and alkali basalt lava flows and cinder cones make up the late Quaternary Hurricane volcanic field HVF in the Colorado Plateau/Basin and Range transition zone of southwestern Utah. Strombolian-and Hawaiian-style eruptions produced thin 10 m a'a lava flows and 10 cinder and scoria cones that group geographically into five clusters. The five clusters can be further divided into four isotopic magma types that vary in super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr from 0.7035 to 0.7049, epsilon sub Nd from 1.6 to -7.5, and super 206 Pb/ super 204 Pb from 17.4 to 18.7. Except for the Radio Towers and Volcano Mountain cone clusters, each volcano had a different parent magma and evolved by fractional crystallization of different amounts and proportions of olivine and clinopyroxene. Parent magmas of each isotope group formed by 0.5%-7% partial melting of lithospheric mantle composed of fertile lherzolite varying in garnet content from 1 to 4 wt %. New super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar dates indicate that the HVF formed over a period of at least 100 ka during the late Quaternary. Along a transect from the Basin and Range to the Colorado Plateau, the source for Pliocene-late Quaternary alkali basalt magmas changes from asthenosphere in the Basin and Range to lithospheric mantle on the Colorado Plateau. The melting of a heterogeneous lithospheric mantle is the most viable mechanism for producing the observed chemical variability in the transition zone-Colorado Plateau part of the transect. Furthermore, chemical differences across the transect may reflect a major lithospheric boundary originally defined on the basis of Nd and Pb isotopes that is older and perhaps more fundamental than the present structural and physiographic boundary between the Basin and Range and Colorado Plateau.

ABSTRACT: Available paleomagnetic and radiometric results for about 60 igneous rocks 3.6 m.y. old or less are consistent with the following geomagnetic polarity epoch time scale: Brunhes normal, 0.0 to 0.85+ or -0.15 m.y.; Matuyama reversed, 0.85+ or -15 to 2.4+ or -0.1 m.y.; Gauss normal, 2.4+ or -0.1 to 3.35+ or -0.1 m.y.; Gilbert reversed, 3.35+ or -0.1 m.y. to ?. A brief interval of normal polarity the Olduvai event occurs within the Matuyama epoch at about 1.9 m.y., and a brief interval of reversed polarity the Mammoth event occurs within the Gauss epoch at about 3.06 m.y. Data for 12 units from eastern California and Nevada, reported here for the first time, are particularly useful in defining the Gauss-Gilbert boundary and for recognizing the Mammoth event.

ABSTRACT: Total dissolved H (sub 2) O and major element abundances were measured in basalt and basaltic andesite glass inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from Quaternary eruptions of four subduction-related volcanoes to test the hypothesis that low-MgO high-alumina basalts contain high H (sub 2) O at depth [1] and to reveal any petrogenetically significant correlations between arc basalt compositions and H (sub 2) O contents. Total dissolved H (sub 2) O (combined molecular H (sub 2) O and OH groups) measured by ion microprobe in mafic glass inclusions from the 1974 eruption of Fuego, Guatemala, reaches 6.2 wt.%. Dissolved H (sub 2) O contents decrease in more evolved Fuego glasses. Correlations of H (sub 2) O with MgO, Na (sub 2) O, K (sub 2) O, S and Cl indicate that aqueous fluid exsolution during magma ascent forced crystallization and differentiation of residual liquids. Low-K (sub 2) O magnesian high-alumina basalt glass inclusions from the 3 ka eruption of Black Crater (Medicine Lake volcano, California) have low H (sub 2) O contents, near 0.2 wt.%, which are consistent with the MORB-like character of these and other primitive lavas of the Medicine Lake region. Basalt and basaltic andesite glass inclusions from Copco Cone and Goosenest volcano on the Cascade volcanic front north of Mt. Shasta have H (sub 2) O contents of up to 3.3 wt.%. The range of H (sub 2) O contents in Cascade mafic magmas is too large to have resulted solely from enrichment by crystallization and indicates the participation of an H (sub 2) O-rich component in magma generation or crustal-level modification. Whereas fluid-absent melting of amphibole-bearing peridotite can account for the H (sub 2) O in most mafic arc liquids, the very high H (sub 2) O/alkali ratios of the 1974 Fuego eruptives suggest that an aqueous fluid was involved in the generation of Fuego basalts.

ABSTRACT: Inclusions of plutonic, metavolcanic and volcanic rocks are abundant in dacite pumice and lava from the 1980-1986 eruption sequence at Mount St. Helens. Point counts of inclusions exposed in talus blocks from the dome from 1980 through 1983 show that inclusions form approximately 3.5 vol% of the lava. Eighty-five percent of the inclusions are medium-grained gabbros with an average diameter of 6 cm. Additional rock types include quartz diorite, hornfelsic basalt, dacite, andesite and vein quartz. Disaggregated inclusions are common and define shear planes within the dome. These fragmented inclusions may significantly contaminate analyses of the dacite. The gabbroic inclusions are of four distinct types, all with mineral assemblages consistent with crystallization pressures of less than 9 kb. Textures and major-element compositions indicate that most of the gabbroic inclusions are cumulates. The most abundant inclusion type is laminated gabbronorite, which contains up to 9% interstitial glass, derived from partial melting. The presence of quartz veins and hornblende-bearing veins within sheared zones in the laminated gabbronorite indicates that the source of these inclusions was holocrystalline rock that had been penetrated by water-rich fluids. The gabbronorite contained sufficient water to be susceptible to partial melting when the magma that fed the 1980-1986 eruption sequence was emplaced nearby. Various types of gabbroic inclusions, including the laminated gabbronorite, are common in Mount St. Helens lavas of approximately the last 3000 years. This coincides with the interval in which Mount St. Helens first erupted basalt and basaltic andesite lavas. These observations, together with the fact that the gabbroic inclusions are compositionally unlike any of the Tertiary intrusive rocks in the Mount St. Helens area, strongly suggest that the inclusions are related to the introduction of basalt to the Mount St. Helens magmatic system. The source of the gabbros could be a layered mafic pluton formed through crystal accumulation from multiple batches of basaltic magma emplaced at mid- to upper-crustal depths beneath the volcano. The prevalence of explosive eruptions at Mount St. Helens may play a part in bringing the inclusions to the surface. The eruptive products of the cataclysmic eruption of May 18, 1980 contain notably fewer inclusions than the pyroclastic flows and dome lavas erupted subsequently. This suggests that the May 18 eruption shattered conduit wall rock that was subsequently stoped into the magma and carried to the surface later in the eruption series.

ABSTRACT: Dating methods applicable to the last 50,000 yr, such as super 14 C, require absolute calibrations, which are difficult to obtain over much of this interval. Extension of the super 40 Ar- super 39 Ar isochron technique to ages <50,000 yr would make this well-understood absolute dating method available for calibration of cosmic-ray-dependent methods and for dating of young materials not suitable for super 14 C dating. We have dated the Mono craters, California, at 12,560+ or -470 yr, using laser fusion to generate an isochron from 63 sanidine crystals from 5 sites. The near-atmospheric initial isotopic ratios and the agreement in ages from all sites suggest that no significant excess argon is present. It thus appears that, particularly with improved instrumentation and techniques currently under development, most of the super 14 C age range is accessible to super 40 Ar- super 39 Ar laser dating.

ABSTRACT: These rocks were derived from different levels of compositionally zoned magmatic systems. The 2 earliest rhyolites probably were tapped from short-lived silicic reservoirs, in contrast to the other 36 rhyolite domes and lava flows which the isotopic data suggest may have been leaked from the top of a single, long-lived magmatic system. Most Coso basalts show isotopic, geochemical, and mineralogic evidence of interaction with crustal rocks, but one analyzed flow has isotopic ratios that may represent mantle values  super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr = 0.7036, super 206 Pb/ super 204 Pb = 19.05, super 207 Pb/ super 204 Pb = 15.62, super 208 Pb/ super 204 Pb = 38.63. The initial isotopic composition of typical rhyolite  super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr = 0.7053, super 206 Pb/ super 204 Pb = 19.29, super 207 Pb/ super 204 Pb = 15.68, super 208 Pb/ super 204 Pb = 39.00 is representative of the middle or upper crust. Andesitic inclusions in the rhyolites are evidently samples of hybrid magmas from the silicic/mafic interface in vertically zoned magma reservoirs. Silicic endmember compositions inferred for these mixed magmas, however, are not those of erupted rhyolite but reflect the zonation within the silicic part of the magma reservoir. The compositional contrast at the interface between mafic and silicic parts of these systems apparently was greater for the earlier, smaller reservoirs.--Modified journal abstract.

ABSTRACT: The Los Azufres volcanic complex has had a long eruptive history of approximately 1.5 Myr or more less than 3 Myr, subsequent to the building of a large Miocene and Pliocene andesitic complex. Since about 1.5 Ma, its development consists of two main periods of volcanic activity. The first period, from approximately 1.5 to 0.8 Ma, had two magmatic cycles, about 200,000 years in duration, characterized by acidic, followed basaltic volcanism. Such a magmatic evolution suggests successive emptyings of a shallow reservoir in which differentiation previously occurred. About 0.6 Ma, major deep magma supplies were probably responsible for the resurgent doming which led to uplift of the southern part of the caldera. From approximately 0.6 Ma to Present, the second period exposes volcanic products grading from basalts to rhyolites. Considering the recent age of the last ignimbrites 26,000 to 29,000 years, one can assume that the volcanic activity related to a voluminous differentiated magma body at shallow depth has not yet ended, especially in the southern area, in and around the resurgent zone occupied by the geothermal field.

ABSTRACT: Compositional variation among these basalts can be ascribed to crystal fractionation. Erupted volumes of these basalts decrease with increasing differentiation. Mafic lavas containing up to 58% SiO sub 2 , erupted adjacent to the rhyolite field, formed by mixing of basaltic and silicic magma. Basaltic magma interacted with crustal rocks to form other SiO sub 2 -rich mafic lavas erupted near the Sierra Nevada fault zone. Several rhyolite domes in the Coso volcanic field contain sparse andesitic inclusions 55-61% SiO sub 2 . Pillow-like forms, intricate commingling and local diffusive mixing of andesite and rhyolite at contacts, concentric vesicle distribution, and crystal morphologies indicative of undercooling show that inclusions were incorporated in their rhyolitic hosts as blobs of magma. Inclusions were probably dispersed throughout small volumes of rhyolitic magma by convective mechanical mixing. Inclusion magma was formed by mixing hybridization at the interface between basaltic and rhyolitic magmas that coexisted in vertically zoned igneous systems. Relict phenocrysts and the bulk compositions of inclusions suggest that silicic endmembers were less differentiated than erupted high-silica rhyolite. Changes in inferred endmembers of magma mixtures with time suggests that the steepness of chemical gradients near the silicic/mafic interface in the zoned reservoir may have decreased as the system matured, although a high-silica rhyolitic cap persisted. The Coso example is an extreme case of large thermal and compositional contrast between inclusion and host magmas; lesser differences between intermediate composition magmas and inclusions lead to undercooling phenomena that suggest smaller Delta T.--Modified journal abstract.

ABSTRACT: Burroughs Mountain, situated at the northeast foot of Mount Rainier, WA, exposes a large-volume 3.4 km super 3  andesitic lava flow, up to 350 m thick and extending 11 km in length. Two sampling traverses from flow base to eroded top, over vertical sections of 245 and 300 m, show that the flow consists of a felsic lower unit 100 m thick overlain sharply by a more mafic upper unit. The mafic upper unit is chemically zoned, becoming slightly more evolved upward; the lower unit is heterogeneous and unzoned. The lower unit is also more phenocryst-rich and locally contains inclusions of quenched basaltic andesite magma that are absent from the upper unit. Widespread, vuggy, gabbronorite-to-diorite inclusions may be fragments of shallow cumulates, exhumed from the Mount Rainier magmatic system. Chemically heterogeneous block-and-ash-flow deposits that conformably underlie the lava flow were the earliest products of the eruptive episode. The felsic-mafic-felsic progression in lava composition resulted from partial evacuation of a vertically-zoned magma reservoir, in which either 1 average depth of withdrawal increased, then decreased, during eruption, perhaps due to variations in effusion rate, or 2 magmatic recharge stimulated ascent of a plume that brought less evolved magma to shallow levels at an intermediate stage of the eruption. Pre-eruptive zonation resulted from combined crystallization-differentiation and intrusions of less evolved magma into the partly crystallized resident magma body. The zoned lava flow at Burroughs Mountain shows that, at times, Mount Rainier's magmatic system has developed relatively large, shallow reservoirs that, despite complex recharge events, were capable of developing a felsic-upward compositional zonation similar to that inferred from large ash-flow sheets and other zoned lava flows.

ABSTRACT: Alkali basalts erupted during the Quaternary at Crater Flat, Nevada, record a complex history of polycyclic and polygenetic volcanism. Magmas from the two main centers Black Cone and Red Cone are petrographically and geochemically similar, although field evidence suggests a number of separate eruptive events. High incompatible element concentrations, low Nb/La and high Zr/Y indicate that the magmas were derived by small degrees of partial melting from the lithospheric mantle. At Red Cone, a significant range of Sr, La, Ce, Ba and Th concentrations is observed with time e.g., Sr range 1308-1848 ppm: the youngest samples having the more elevated values. However, there is only limited variation in the compatible trace elements e.g., Sc and Ni. The array of compositions at Red Cone could not have been produced by changes in the degree of partial melting, or by fractional crystallization. Rather, a model of magma mixing is proposed between relatively enriched and depleted end-members. The cluster of Black Cone data falls consistently at the least-enriched end of the Red Cone sample arrays, suggesting that the Black Cone magma represents one of the mixing end-members. The modeling indicates that the magmatic plumbing systems of the two centers were linked, at least during the early stages of volcanism. Moreover, volcanic activity may have occurred at a number of sites along the length of the magmatic feeder zone during a single eruptive phase. This could have significant implications for volcanic hazard assessment in the region around Yucca Mountain, and the proposed nuclear waste repository.

ABSTRACT: High-precision K-Ar dating and detailed mapping have established an eruptive chronology for a Cascade stratovolcano and its surrounding array of coeval basaltic centers. Mount Adams is a 200 km super 3 andesitic cone that stands at the center of a coeval 1250 km super 2 Quaternary volcanic field that contains g60 discrete vents. K-Ar ages were measured for 74 samples from 63 of the 136 volcanic units defined in the course of the mapping. Within analytical error, there are no discrepancies between K-Ar ages and stratigraphic sequence. Major activity began in the area ca. 940 ka, and inception of the central stratovolcano took place at ca. 520 ka. A plot of cumulative volume erupted versus time shows that between 940 and 520 ka the eruptive rate was <0.04 km super 3 /k.y. and approximately 80% of the products were basaltic. Andesites are volumetrically dominant and were emplaced in three main cone-building episodes centered at 500, 450, and 30 ka--at eruptive rates of 1.6-5 km super 3 /k.y. At a lower rate of 0.05-0.1 km super 3 /k.y., the magmatic system remained almost continuously active between the main pulses--although breaks in activity as long as 30 k.y. are permitted by the K-Ar data. Andesitic-dacitic activity in the focal region and dominantly basaltic activity on the periphery have coexisted for 520 k.y., and their products are interstratified. The last main episode of cone construction occurred ca. 40-10 ka, the oldest andesite identifiably derived from within the present-day edifice having an age of 33+ or -14 ka. Andesites forming the south-summit rim and the true summit have ages of 13+ or -8 ka and 15+ or -8 ka, respectively. The time-volume-composition data bear upon several fundamental questions concerning the long-term behavior of arc volcanoes. Stratovolcanoes commonly grow in spurts but can stay active between the widely spaced episodes of peak productivity. Large stratocone systems may remain active for half a million years. Subdivision of complex stratovolcanoes into eruptive or constructional stages without detailed mapping, geochronology, and compositional data should be treated skeptically. Discussion of volumetric eruptive rates can be misleading without an adequate time scale. Stratovolcanoes need never develop large upper-crustal magma chambers. Basalt erupts peripherally, but its ascent is suppressed beneath stratovolcanoes by deep-crustal domains of magma storage and hybridization that form where concentrated injection of basalt amplifies crustal melting.

ABSTRACT: The approximately 85 km long Great Rift of southern Idaho bisects thevolcanic depression that forms the eastern Snake River Plain. Thoriumisotope systematics of compositionally diverse lavas of the GreatRift, including those of Craters of the Moon, record a spectrum ofcrust and mantle processes.  super 230 Th/ super 232 Th ratiosrange from 0.87 to 1.11 and are enriched in  super 230 Th withrespect to  super 238 U by up to 13%. Covariations in Th isotopesystematics in lavas from Craters of the Moon reflect crustalassimilation accompanied by fractional crystallization involvingaccessory phases. Temperatures based on apatite and zircon saturationconfirm other estimates of magmatic temperatures and, consideredtogether with volcanic histories, suggest cooling in upper crustalmagma chambers at rates of >10 degrees C/ka. Thermal and chemicalevolution of the Great Rift basalts support their differentiation atlower crustal conditions. Although basalts of the eastern Snake RiverPl ain are generally interpreted as having originated in ancientenriched mantle lithosphere beneath southern Idaho, they shareremarkable chemical similarities with oceanic basalts derived fromenriched sources attributed to mantle plumes. Thorium isotopesignatures of the Great Rift basalts are those of depleted mantle,resulting in the most extreme case of disparity between super 232Th/ super 238 U ratios delimited by Th and Pb isotope systematics.It is difficult to account for this decoupling by invokingsubduction-related U enrichment. A more likely explanation ismetasomatism of hybrid lithospheric mantle in the wake of theYellowstone plume.

ABSTRACT: The Trans-Mexican volcanic belt is an active volcanic arc related to subduction along the Middle America trench and characterized by shallow seismicity and synvolcanic to postvolcanic extensional arc-parallel faulting. Major intra-arc basins within the central part of the belt between long 99 degrees W and 102 degrees W are from west to east the Cuitzeo and Acambay grabens, the Aljibes half-graben, and the Mezquital graben. In this region, approximately 100 east-west-striking, >2 km long, steeply dipping normal faults, expressed by pronounced multi-event fault scarps, have been mapped. Of the 100 faults, approximately 65 displace rocks of known Quaternary age younger than 1.6 Ma, and 22 cut rocks with a documented age younger than 750 ka. Known historical surface ruptures are limited to faults of the Acambay graben. Overall, the faults cause north-south to north-northwest-south-southeast-oriented extension of <1 km, which is distributed over a 30-50-km-wide zone that has 5-10 faults in cross section and a relative extension of <3%. Quaternary vertical slip rates, estimated for 13 of the faults, have a mean of 0.07 mm /yr. They are highest at the southern margin of the Cuitzeo graben, the northern margin of the Acambay graben, and in the Aljibes half-graben, where they measure between 0.16 and 0.18 mm /yr. The north-south to north-northwest-south-southeast-oriented Quaternary bulk extension rate of the system is likely to be 0.2+ or -0.05 mm/yr. This fault system is in an initial stage of coalescence. Its western and eastern parts consist mostly of isolated fault segments, whereas in the central part deformation is localized onto a few through-going faults. The longest of these are the Venta de Bravo fault 45 km and the Acambay-Tixmadeje fault 34 km. The short fault traces have a simple structure, whereas the longer ones are commonly composed of two or more segments. There is no obvious migratory pattern of Quaternary fault activity, which suggests that the entire region is tectonically active.

ABSTRACT: Basaltic and andesitic lava from the Cascades have been studied. They are weakly porphyritic, containing phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite, and olivine or orthopyroxene; these phases are also found in the groundmass. Titanomagnetite is a groundmass phase in most of thelavas, and a subcalcic augite is found in the groundmass in some of thebasic lavas. Orthopyroxenes are present only in salic lavas and the Ca increases with increasing iron. The composition range of phenocryst and groundmass plagioclase is very similar except that phenocrysts extend to more calcic. Residual glasses in many lavas are rhyolitic. Lavas from the different craters can be distinguished from one another by chemistry and mineralogy. The most likely origin for the orogenic lavas of the Cascades is by partial melting of the upper mantle.

ABSTRACT: Chemically primitive late Cenozoic tholeiitic basalts from the northwestern U.S.A. have Os-isotopic compositions more radiogenic than observed for most basalts from the ocean basins. This result is inconsistent with the simple petrogenetic model that explains the geographically correlated Sr-, Nd- and Pb-isotopic variation in these basalts as resulting solely from melting of metasomatized lithospheric mantle peridotite of varying age across this area. A magma source composed of a mixture of peridotite and pyroxenite/eclogite also fails because at the high percentage of mafic component required to explain the observed Nd-Os isotope systematics, this mixed source would not produce melts that match the major- and trace-element compositions of the observed olivine tholeiites. A more likely explanation for the observed isotopic compositions involves interaction of sublithospheric primary melts that are similar in composition to mid-ocean ridge basalt MORB with high- super 187 Os/ super 188 Os materials in the lower crust or lithospheric mantle. Though not uniquely defined, mass-balance calculations suggest that the lithospheric component is mafic-potassic in composition, possibly a small-volume melt of mafic material in the lower crust or upper mantle. If the radiogenic Os is attributable to such interaction, the isotopic compositions of the tholeiites can be satisfied by 2-25% addition of the lithospheric component to a primitive MORB parental magma. These results show that the Os-isotope system in continental basalts can provide a clear distinction between magmas derived by melting isotopically evolved peridotitic lithosphere and those produced from a sublithospheric primary melt contaminated by mafic material in the lithosphere.

ABSTRACT: Rhenium-osmium isotopic systematics of primitive calc-alkaline lavas from the Lassen region appear to be controlled by mantle wedge processes. Lavas with a large proportion of slab component have relatively low Re and Os abundances, and have radiogenic Os and mid ocean ridge basalt-like Sr and Pb isotopic compositions. Lavas with a small proportion of slab component have higher Re and Os elemental abundances and display mantle-like Os, Sr, Nd, and Pb isotopic compositions. Assimilation with fractional crystallization can only generate the Re-Os systematics of the Lassen lavas from a common parent if the distribution coefficient for Re in sulfide is approximately 40-1100 times higher than most published estimates and if most incompatible element abundances decrease during differentiation. High Re/Os ratios in mid ocean ridge basalts makes subducted oceanic crust a potential source of radiogenic Os in volcanic arcs. The slab beneath the southernmost Cascades is estimated to have super 187 Os/ super 188 Os ratios as high as 1.4. Mixing between a slab component and mantle wedge peridotite can generate the Os isotopic systematics of the Lassen lavas provided the slab component has a Sr/Os ratio of approximately 7.5X10 super 5 and Os abundances that are 100-600 times higher than mid ocean ridge basalts. For this model to be correct, Os must be readily mobilized and concentrated in the slab component, perhaps as a result of high water and HCl fugacities in this subduction environment. Another possible mechanism to account for the correlation between the magnitude of the subduction geochemical signature and Os isotopic composition involves increasing the stability of an Os-bearing phase in mantle wedge peridotites as a result of fluxing with the slab component. Melting of such a source could yield low Os magmas that are more susceptible to crustal contamination, and hence have more radiogenic Os isotopic compositions, than magmas derived from sources with a smaller contribution from the slab. Thus, the addition of the slab component to the mantle wedge appears to result in either the direct or indirect addition of radiogenic Os to arc magmas.

ABSTRACT: super 40 Ar/ super 39 Ar ages were determined on the three majorash-flow tuffs of the Yellowstone Plateau volcanic field in the regionof Yellowstone National Park in order to improve the precision ofpreviously determined ages. Total-fusion and incremental-heating agesof sanidine yielded the following mean ages: Huckleberry RidgeTuff--2.059 + or - 0.004 Ma; Mesa Falls Tuff--1.285 + or - 0.004 Ma;and Lava Creek Tuff--0.639 + or - 0.002 Ma. The Huckleberry Ridge Tuffhas a transitional magnetic direction and has previously been relatedto the Reunion Normal-Polarity Subchron. Dating of the Reunion eventhas been reviewed and its ages have been normalized to a common valuefor mineral standards. The age of the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff issignificantly younger than lava flows of the Reunion event on ReunionIsland, supporting other evidence for a normal-polarity event youngerthan the Reunion event.

ABSTRACT: Volcanic samples representing a wide range of lithologies and compositions were collected from the Miocene to Quaternary age Michoacan-Guanajuato volcanic field MGVF in the Trans-Mexican volcanic belt TMVB. The samples were analyzed for major and trace elements, and super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr and super 187 Os/ super 188 Os in an effort differentiate the importance of source contamination and assimilation in continental arc magmatism. Re concentrations in the MGVF samples range from 0.03 to 0.13 ppb and Os concentrations range from 0.05 to 0.001 ppb. The super 87 Sr/ super 86 Sr of the samples vary little, ranging from 0.7037 to 0.7047, despite a wide range in major element composition. However, the super 187 Os/ super 188 Os vary greatly, from 0.135 to 0.410. Decreasing Os concentration and increasing super 187 Os/ super 188 Os show a clear relation with indicators of fractionation such as MgO or Ni. A plot of super 187 Os/ super 188 Os versus Ba/Nb for all samples from the MGVF show two distinct trends: 1 a wide variation in Ba/Nb 50-200 associated with minor variations in super 187 Os/ super 188 Os  approximately 0.135-0.145, and 2 increasing super 187 Os/ super 188 Os 0.145-0.40 associated with restricted Ba/Nb 35-70. These trends are best explained through a dynamic multi-component process. Fluids are released from the subducting slab, resulting in melting of the overlying asthenospheric wedge. The pristine fluids have high Ba and low Re and Os concentrations. The resulting melts have variable Ba/Nb, but unradiogenic super 187 Os/ super 188 Os. Superimposed upon these melts are both assimilation and fractional crystallization processes, which affect both the Ba/Nb and super 187 Os/ super 188 Os systems as they ascend into the lower crust.

ABSTRACT: The lamproite lavas of the Leucite Hills, Wyoming comprise an isolated volcanic field of mesas and buttes, which erupted onto a thick sequence of K/T shales and sandstones. Volcanic activity spanned the interval from 3.0 to 0.89 Ma, during which time <0.7 km (super 3) of magma were erupted. Approximately 84% of the magma was erupted within a 10-90 ky interval (between 0.94 and 0.89 Ma), with an average eruption rate of approximately 5 m (super 3) /km (super 2) /yr (more than an order of magnitude lower than the background trickle eruption rate at continental arcs). The eruption rate prior to this burst of activity, between 3.0 and 0.94 Ma, was two orders of magnitude lower at approximately 0.02 m (super 3) /km (super 2) /yr. There is a strong correlation (r (super 2) = 0.99) between the height of the volcanic mesas (the volcanic cap protects the underlying sediment from erosion) and their eruption age, providing an average sediment erosion rate of 0.113+ or -0.002 mm/yr over the last 2.5 million years. Recent seismic studies indicate that the Leucite Hills volcanic field overlies an abrupt transition in lithospheric structure between the Archean craton to the north (with fast upper mantle seismic velocities) and the Colorado Plateau to the south (with a low-velocity zone similar to that beneath East Pacific Rise spreading ridge). The trigger for the Leucite Hills magmatism may be related, therefore, to the recent emplacement of asthenospheric mantle immediately to the south and not necessarily to the more distant Yellowstone hotspot to the north.

ABSTRACT: Single-crystal laser-probe (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar dating of 133 grains of sanidine and plagioclase has enabled us to resolve the eruption ages of the Upper Basin Member rhyolites--the lava flows and related tuffs that erupted within the Yellowstone Caldera shortly after its collapse 630 ky ago on eruption of the Lava Creek Tuff. Two lavas and a tuff that erupted from the eastern ring-fracture zone yield an eruptive age of 481+ or -8 ka, whereas two flows from the western ring-fracture zone yield eruptive ages of 516+ or -7 and 198+ or -8 ka. Most of the units contain old xenocrysts, explaining why previous attempts at dating these earliest post-caldera units by the conventional K-Ar method yielded poorly resolved and, in some cases, anomalous ages. The tuff shows the most severe contamination. Grains from a single pumice lapilli in the tuff show as large an age range as those from bulk vitrophyre, indicating that the xenocrysts were incorporated in the magma prior to its near-surface explosive fragmentation. Diffusion calculations indicate that the xenocrysts could not have remained in the magma for more than a few years without degassing and giving ages indistinguishable from the phenocrysts. Thus, the contamination represented by the xenocrysts probably occurred during fracturing and conduit propagation, rather than during caldera collapse, which took place more than 100 ky earlier. The apparent ages of xenocrysts and their compositions as determined by electron microprobe suggest that the Eocene Absaroka volcanics are the main contaminant, with a single xenocryst probably coming from Precambrian basement rocks. Most of the xenocrysts are difficult to distinguish optically or chemically from feldspar phenocrysts, illustrating the necessity of single-crystal analysis to date many young volcanic rocks accurately.

ABSTRACT: Kulshan caldera (4.5X8 km), at the northeast foot of Mount Baker, isfilled with rhyodacite ignimbrite (1.15 Ma) and postcaldera lavas andis only the third Quaternary caldera identified in the Cascade arc. Agravity traverse across the caldera yields a steep-sided, symmetrical,complete Bouguer anomaly of -16 mGal centered over the caldera.Density considerations suggest that the caldera fill, which is incisedto an observed thickness of 1 km, may be about 1.5 km thick and isflat-floored, overlying a cylindrical piston of subsided metamorphicrocks. Outflow sheets have been stripped by advances of theCordilleran Ice Sheet, but the climactic fallout (Lake Tapps tephra)is as thick as 30 cm some 200 km south of the caldera. Ten precalderaunits, which range in (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar age from 1.29 to1.15 Ma, are dikes and erosional scraps that probably never amountedto a large edifice. A dozen postcaldera rhyodacite lavas and dikesrange in age from 1.15 to 0.99 Ma; rhyodacites have subsequently beenabsent, the silicic reservoir having finally crystallized. At least 60early Pleistocene intermediate dikes next intruded the caldera fill,helping energize an acid-sulfate hydrothermal system and constitutingthe main surviving record of an early postcaldera andesite-dacite pilepresumed to have been large. Most of the pre- and postcalderarhyodacites were dated by (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar or K-Armethods, and 13 were drilled for remanent magnetic directions. Inagreement with the radiometric ages, the paleomagnetic data indicatethat eruptions took place before, during, and after the JaramilloNormal Polarity Subchron, and that one rhyodacite with transitionalpolarity may represent the termination of the Jaramillo. Most of thebiotite-hornblende-orthopyroxene-plagioclase rhyodacite lavas, dikes,and tuffs are in the range 68-73% SiO (sub 2) , but there were largecompositional fluctuations during the 300-kyr duration of therhyodacite episode. The rhyodacitic magma reservoir was wider (11 km)than the caldera that collapsed into it (8 km).

ABSTRACT: Mount St. Helens volcano has intermittently produced mainly dacitic products but occasionally erupted a more diverse suite of lavas including basalts and andesites. Petrogenetic relations between these magmas provide insight into the dynamics of the subjacent magma system. Mineralogical and geochemical features of representative lavas erupted during the past 2200 years can distinguish three basaltic and three andesitic variants. The mafic lavas include: a transitional, olivine+plagioclase basalts with low K sub 2 O and incompatible trace-element abundances; b calc-alkaline, olivine+plagioclase+ or -clinopyroxene basalts enriched in K sub 2 O, TiO sub 2 , and incompatible trace elements; and c calc-alkaline, olivine+plagioclase basaltic andesites with incompatible trace-element contents transitional between the two basalt types. Intermediate lavas include a tholeiitic, two-pyroxene andesites, b calc-alkaline, plagioclase+two-pyroxenes+ or -olivine+ or -amphibole mafic andesites 56-59% wt.% SiO sub 2 , and c calc-alkaline, plagioclase+two-pyroxenes+amphibole high-silica andesites 61-62 wt.% SiO sub 2 . Eruption of these magmatic variants within the same eruptive phase implies the existence of different petrogenetic lineages, and that the plumbing system is sufficiently complex to simultaneously isolate and preserve numerous magma batches. It is unlikely that any of the andesites or dacites are derived by fractional crystallization of the recognized basaltic variants. Formation of the andesites simply by contamination or assimilation-fractional crystallization of basaltic magma is also improbable. More plausibly, the andesites represent mixing between basaltic and dacitic end-member magmas, each of which may be somewhat heterogeneous or vary in composition with time. In this model, efficient mixing must occur in some parts of the magma plumbing system, while some conduits or storage reservoirs must be effectively isolated.

ABSTRACT: The Jaramillo Event was originally defined by Doell and Dalrymple in1966 on the basis of K-Ar ages from sanidine in the normally,transitionally and reversely magnetized rhyolite domes named Cerro delAbrigo, Cerro Santa Rosa I and Cerro Santa Rosa II, respectively, thaterupted following collapse of the archetypal Valles Caldera, NewMexico. We have collected new paleomagnetic data from the three domesand new (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar laser fusion and furnaceincremental heating experiments on sanidine crystals from the CerroSanta Rosa I rhyolite. Step-wise alternating field and thermaldemagnetization techniques applied to 52 samples from seven sitesindicate that the original paleomagnetic results of Doell andDalrymple [Science 152 (1966) 1060-1061] are valid. Cerro del Abrigois normally magnetized, whereas the Santa Rosa I dome is transitionalwith an inclination of -63 degrees toward the east and the Santa RosaII dome is of reversed polarity. Twenty-five laser fusion experimentson sanidine crystals from the the Cerro Santa Rosa I dome, togetherwith the saddle-shaped spectrum obtained by incrementally heating thesanidine in a furnace reveal that this rhyolite contained a small butsignificant component of excess argon prior to eruption. Our preferredage of 936+ or -8 ka (+ or -2sigma ) for the Santa Rosa I rhyolite isbased on the concordant laser fusion isochron and incremental heatingplateau ages. This age is significantly older than was inferred on thebasis of earlier laser fusion (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar resultsthat suggested a trapped component characterized by a (super 40) Ar/(super 36) Ar ratio lower than the atmospheric value of 295.5. Our newage distinguishes the Santa Rosa I dome by 65 kyr from the terminationof the Jaramillo normal subchron 1001+ or -10 ka and by 37 kyr frombasaltic lavas at Haleakala and Tahiti, which record the KamikatsuraEvent 899+ or -6 ka. Moreover, this determination is a factor of threemore precise than the best previous estimate for a proposedgeomagnetic event in this time period. The Cerro Santa Rosa I rhyolitedome, once intimately linked with the end of the Jaramillo Event andthe acceptance of plate tectonic theory, now defines a highly resolvedfeature, the Santa Rosa Event, in a terrestrial geomagnetic reversaltime scale that is consistent with the global record of magnetic fieldintensity from marine sediments.

ABSTRACT: Sixty-nine ion microprobe spot analyses of zircons from four granitesamples from the plutonic complex that underlies the Geysersgeothermal field yield (super 207) Pb/ (super 206) Pb vs. (super 238)U/ (super 206) Pb concordia ages ranging from 1.13+ or -0.04 Ma to1.25+ or -0.04 (1sigma ) Ma. The weighted mean of the U/Pb model agesis 1.18+ or -0.03 Ma. The U-Pb ages coincide closely with (super 40)Ar/ (super 39) Ar age spectrum plateau and terminal ages fromcoexisting K-feldspars and with the eruption ages of overlyingvolcanic rocks. The data indicate that the granite crystallized at1.18 Ma and had cooled below 350 degrees C by approximately 0.9-1.0Ma. Interpretation of the feldspar (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar agedata using multi-diffusion domain theory indicates thatpost-emplacement rapid cooling was succeeded either by slower coolingfrom 350 degrees to 300 degrees C between 1.0 and 0.4 Ma or transitoryreheating to 300-350 degrees C at about 0.4-0.6 Ma. Subsequent rapidcooling to below 260 degrees C between 0.4 and 0.2 Ma is in agreementwith previous proposals that vapor-dominated conditions were initiatedwithin the hydrothermal system at this time. Heat flow calculationsconstrained with K-feldspar thermal histories and the present elevatedregional heat flow anomaly demonstrate that appreciable heat inputfrom sources external to the known Geysers plutonic complex isrequired to maintain the geothermal system. This requirement issatisfied by either a large, underlying, convecting magma chamber (nowsolidified) emplaced at 1.2 Ma or episodic intrusion of smaller bodiesfrom 1.2 to 0.6 Ma.

ABSTRACT: Accurate ages for young (e.g., Pleistocene) volcanic eruptions areimportant for geomorphic, tectonic, climatic, and hazard studies.Existing techniques can be time-consuming and expensive when many agesare needed, and in the case of K/Ar and (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ardating, extraneous Ar often can limit precision, especially forcontinental basalts erupted through old lithosphere. We present a newtechnique for dating young basaltic eruptions by (U-Th)/He dating ofzircons (ZHe) from crustal xenoliths. Single-crystal ZHe datesgenerally have lower precision than typical (super 40) Ar/ (super 39)Ar dates, but can be determined relatively easily on multiplereplicate grain aliquots. We dated zircons from xenoliths from fourvolcanic centers in western North America: Little Bear Mountain,British Columbia (157+ or -3.5 [2.2%] ka weighted 95% confidenceinterval [CI], mean square of weighted deviates [MSWD] = 1.7) andPrindle Volcano, Alaska (176+ or -16 [8.9%] ka, MSWD = 13), in thenorthern Cordilleran volcanic province, and Fish Springs (273+ or -23[8.6%], MSWD = 43) and Oak Creek (179+ or -8.1 [4.5%] ka, MSWD = 12),in the Big Pine Volcanic Field, California. All ZHe ages are eitherequivalent to or younger than previously determined K/Ar or (super 40)Ar/ (super 39) Ar ages, indicating the possibility of inherited (super40) Ar in some of the previous measurements. Zircons from uppercrustal xenoliths in the Oak Creek and Fish Springs vents show poorerreproducibility and multiple apparent age distribution peaks,consistent with either intracrystalline U-Th zonation or <99.99% Hedegassing (assuming ca. 100 Ma pre-entrainment ZHe ages) of somezircons during magmatic entrainment. Removal of clear outliers in theolder age-distribution peaks of the upper crustal xenoliths, most ofwhich have extremely high U compared to other zircons of the samexenolith, improve the reproducibilities of Fish Springs to 4.7% (95%CI, MSWD = 4.8) and Oak Creek to 3.4% (95% CI, MSWD = 6.2). Coupledthermal and He diffusion modeling using appropriate xenolith sizes andmagma temperatures and assuming published diffusion kinetics forzircon indicate that incomplete He degassing would require entrainmenttimes <1 h. However, the observation of extremely high U in mostzircons with older ages raises the possibility that zircons with highradiation dosages may have more retentive He diffusioncharacteristics.

ABSTRACT: This study reports oxygen isotope ratios determined by laserfluorination of mineral separates (mainly plagioclase) from basalticandesitic to rhyolitic composition volcanic rocks erupted from theLassen Volcanic Center (LVC), northern California. Plagioclaseseparates from nearly all rocks have delta (super 18) O values(6.1-8.4ppm) higher than expected for production of the magmas bypartial melting of little evolved basaltic lavas erupted in the arcfront and back-arc regions of the southernmost Cascades during thelate Cenozoic. Most LVC magmas must therefore contain high (super 18)O crustal material. In this regard, the delta (super 18) O values ofthe volcanic rocks show strong spatial patterns, particularly foryoung rhyodacitic rocks that best represent unmodified partial meltsof the continental crust. Rhyodacitic magmas erupted from ventslocated within 3.5 km of the inferred center of the LVC haveconsistently lower delta (super 18) O values (average 6.3ppm+ or-0.1ppm) at given SiO (sub 2) contents relative to rocks erupted fromdistal vents (>7.0 km; average 7.1ppm+ or -0.1ppm). Further, magmaserupted from vents situated at transitional distances haveintermediate values and span a larger range (average 6.8ppm+ or-0.2ppm). Basaltic andesitic to andesitic composition rocks showsimilar spatial variations, although as a group the delta (super 18) Ovalues of these rocks are more variable and extend to higher valuesthan the rhyodacitic rocks. These features are interpreted to reflectassimilation of heterogeneous lower continental crust by mafic magmas,followed by mixing or mingling with silicic magmas formed by partialmelting of initially high (super 18) O continental crust (approximately 9.0ppm) increasingly hybridized by lower delta (super18) O ( approximately 6.0ppm) mantle-derived basaltic magmas towardthe center of the system. Mixing calculations using estimatedendmember source delta (super 18) O values imply that LVC magmascontain on a molar oxygen basis approximately 42 to 4% isotopicallyheavy continental crust, with proportions declining in a broadlyregular fashion toward the center of the LVC. Conversely, the delta(super 18) O values of the rhyodacitic rocks suggest that thecontinental crust in the melt generation zones beneath the LVC hasbeen substantially modified by intrusion of mantle-derived basalticmagmas, with the degree of hybridization ranging on a molar oxygenbasis from approximately 60% at distances up to 12 km from the centerof the system to 97% directly beneath the focus region. These resultsdemonstrate on a relatively small scale the strong influence thatintrusion of mantle-derived mafic magmas can have on modifying thecomposition of pre-existing continental crust in regions of meltproduction. Given this result, similar, but larger-scale, regionaltrends in magma compositions may reflect an analogous but moreextensive process wherein the continental crust becomes progressivelyhybridized beneath frontal arc localities as a result of protractedintrusion of subduction-related basaltic magmas.

ABSTRACT: At least 13 times during the Pleistocene Epoch lava flowed into theinner gorge of the Grand Canyon and formed lava dams, as high as 600m, that temporarily blocked the flow of the Colorado River. K-Ar ageson these lava dams indicate that the seven youngest formed within ashort period of time between about 0.6 and 0.4 mega-annum (Ma). Thephysiography of the lava dam remnants within the canyon shows thateach dam was destroyed by erosion, the Colorado River rapidly reachingits pre-existing grade level, before the next dam was emplaced by neweruptions. The total time for emplacement and destruction for anindividual lava dam was probably as little as 0.01-0.02 million years.The K-Ar ages of the two oldest dams, the Lava Butte dam (0.577 + or -0.054 Ma) and the Prospect dam (0.684 + or - 0.051 Ma) are somewhatyounger than the physiography of their remnants suggest.

ABSTRACT: We undertook a (super 40) Ar/ (super 39) Ar study of young mafic and silicic lavas at Mammoth Mountain and the Long Valley caldera (east-central California) to better understand the frequency of these eruptions and the magmatic plumbing system that drives them. Our results show that most of Mammoth Mountain, a lava-dome complex straddling the southwestern topographic rim of the caldera, consists of trachydacite lavas erupted at ca. 68 ka. These ages and new 29- and 41 ka ages for trachydacite lavas in the northwest quadrant of the caldera indicate that these silicic lavas are considerably younger than previously thought. Mafic lavas vented widely in the western third of the caldera in the past 190,000 years, suggesting that this area has not been underlain by large bodies of silicic magma during this interval, as such magma would have prevented the rise of the denser basaltic magma. We identify four eruptive sequences over the past 190,000 years: the western moat sequence ( approximately 190-160 ka), the Mammoth sequence ( approximately 120-58 ka), the northwest caldera sequence ( approximately 41-29 ka), and the Inyo chain sequence ( approximately 9 ka-present). In each eruptive sequence mafic and silicic lavas erupted contemporaneously from spatially associated vents. This suggests that intrusion of alkali basalt into the shallow crust led to the silicic eruptions. If the seismic unrest and deformation of the past three decades is a result of basalt injected beneath Mammoth Mountain and perhaps the western third of the caldera, then there is the possibility of spatially associated small-volume silicic eruptions, which would typically be considerably more explosive. In the past 40,000 years, eruptions have occurred along a N-S linear trend less than 10 km wide, limiting the zone subject to volcanic hazards. Our data bear on Pleistocene glaciation in the region. Ages of 162+ or -2 ka and 99+ or -1 ka for bracketing mafic lava flows better constrain the age of the Casa Diablo till. Our results provide equivocal support for a suggested anticorrelation between volcanism and glaciation for the past 800,000 years in eastern California (Glazner et al., 1999).

ABSTRACT: Geochronologic data from the southern margins of the Colorado Plateau (western United States) show an inboard radial migration of Neogene basaltic magmatism. Nd and Sr isotopic data show that as basaltic volcanism migrates inboard it also becomes increasingly more asthenospheric. Strongly asthenospheric alkali basalt (epsilon (sub Nd) >4) appeared on the western plateau margin ca. 5 Ma, on the southeastern margin at 7 Ma, and is lacking from the plateau's other margins. Tomographic data suggest that low-velocity mantle underlies almost all recent (younger than 1 Ma) basaltic volcanism in a ring around much of the Colorado Plateau at a depth of 80 km. The combined isotopic and tomographic data indicate that the low-velocity mantle is asthenosphere along the western and southeastern margins of the plateau, but modified lithosphere around the remaining margins. Temporal and spatial patterns suggest a process by which upwelling asthenosphere is progressively infiltrating and replacing lithospheric mantle, especially where Proterozoic boundaries exist. This model explains (1) the dramatic velocity contrast seen well inboard of the physiographic edge of the plateau, (2) the inboard sweep of Neogene magmatism, and (3) isotopic evidence that much (but not all) of the low-velocity mantle is asthenospheric. These data support models that ongoing uplift of the edges of the Colorado Plateau is driven by mantle processes.
