# Sedimentary compositions in terms of weathering and provenance 

Data and R scripts utilised in the publication "Major-element composition of sediments in terms of weathering and provenance: implications for crustal recycling" [link to EarthArXiv paper]

## Code

An R-markdown script that is written in R X.X.X. This can be viewed in Rstudio [link]. 

This script shows the PCA performed on the sedmietnary rock dataset. 

Also includes R functions to derive the coefficients omega and psi from any major elemental composition.
