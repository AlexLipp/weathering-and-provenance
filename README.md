# Sedimentary compositions in terms of weathering and provenance 

Data and R scripts utilised in the publication "Major-element composition of sediments in terms of weathering and provenance: implications for crustal recycling" [link to EarthArXiv paper]. Please cite this paper if the scripts are utilised.

## Code

The R-markdown document "YYYYYYYYYYYY.Rmd" contains a function written in `R` which calculates the coefficients omega and psi for any major elemental composition (`find_coefficients`) as well as functions to calculate the model residuals (`find_residuals`) and the fitted values (`find_fit`). The document also demonstrates the application of principal component analysis on the dataset of sedimentary rock major element compositions. 

This R-markdown document requires R X.X.X and can be viewed in Rstudio[link]. 

If this script is used, please cite the original paper.

## Data

Data used in the publication is contained in the folder "data". References for data sources is found in `data_references.pdf`, alongside the data.
